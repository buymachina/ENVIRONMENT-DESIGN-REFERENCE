# ENVIRONMENT-DESIGN-REFERENCE
### THIS USES [TAGSTUDIO](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/releases)! Browsing normally will work, but TagStudio allows for many more features.
My personal catalog of reference material for level design. Feel free to make a pull request with additions.

To open the library, select "add/create library" in TagStudio, and select the folder that CONTAINS the .TagStudio database folder. Not the database folder itself. Select the one that has it and the images in it.
